            If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would it be?

            I guess it would be Seattle, Washington. I never went there (no, the airport doesn't count), but I hear that it's a very lively and large city.
            It houses tons of services such as restaurants and tech shops, a lot of big companies such as Microsoft, and many prospective people my age with a
            vast variety of interests - video games, music genres, TV shows, and so forth. Of course, I can't mention Seattle without the Seattle Tower, an attraction that
            looks futuristic, even today. I hear that it's not just a marvel on the outside; some fancy restaurants within the tower serve food with a grand view of the city. Some fancy
            spaghetti in one of the cores of the future - is that not cool?

            A person that I admire (past or present)
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Sonic the Hedgehog</li>
            <li>Yoda</li>
            <li>Kurt Cobain</li>
            <li>Bill Gates</li>
            <li>My middle school crush</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            My idol <i>was</i> Sonic the Hedgehog because he was cool with attitude, and he let nothing change the very cool attitude that made Sonic who he is.
